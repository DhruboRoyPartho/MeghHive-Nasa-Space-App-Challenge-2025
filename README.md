# MeghHive | Nasa Space App Challenge-2025
## Team: MeghHive 
## Challenge: From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies 
Project Description: Team MeghHive is building a cloud-powered web application that forecasts air quality by combining NASAâ€™s TEMPO satellite data with ground sensors and weather information. Using AI/ML models (LSTM, XGBoost) for time-series prediction, our solution delivers real-time air quality insights, health alerts, and recommendations. The system is built with Python (Flask/Django), Node.js, React.js, Leaflet.js maps, and Plotly charts, and deployed on scalable cloud platforms (AWS/GCP). By transforming EarthData into action, we aim to protect vulnerable communities and move toward cleaner, healthier skies.
